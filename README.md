These are the files that I use for my every new arch install on my laptops. Simple and fast. Sane key bindings.

If you want to use.

Just copy these files to the respective locations. Folders and picom.conf in ~/.config , x.sh i normally put in ~/.local/bin and call it from my .xinitrc.

.xinitrc and .Xresources and .bashrc go in the $HOME folder.

That's it, Just log into tty hit startx and done.

Install nitrogen for wallpapers. Also includes the pkg list normally installed on my system.

Install Chrome or Ms edge, Light (to control backlight), gromit-mpx from AUR.
